#Backup Log Builder

I needed an easy way to make sure our tape backup system is followed correctly while I am absent from work for a few weeks.

Thus it was born.

We have 2 sets of weekday tapes (monday - thursday, A and B) and 5 fridays (1 - 5), as well as monthlies we use on the last friday of the month.

If you have more/less weekday rounds add it to $weekdays. If you have more/less fridays, add it to $fridays, both in code.

Other than that, navigate to index, hit print, and you're set for the rest of the year!
